 :commentary "\
Provides procedures to construct an HTML document easily.  For
example, you can construct an HTML table by the following code:

(html-table :border \"1\" 
 (html-tr (html-th \"Item No\") (html-th \"Quantity\"))
 (html-tr (html-td \"1\") (html-td \"120\")) 
 (html-tr (html-td \"2\") (html-td \"30\")) 
 (html-tr (html-td \"3\") (html-td \"215\")))

There are mainly two functions to access the constructed
tree. `html-lite-write-tree' writes the tree indented to the
current ouput stream and `html-lite-browse-tree' use
`browse-url-browser-function' to browse the tree.

You can construct complete html tree by using:

(append
 (html-doctype)
 (html-html
  (html-head
   (html-title \"Title\"))
  (html-body \"Content\")))

But the simpler way would be jsut to use `with-html-lite-header' like 

(with-html-lite-header \"Title\" 
  (html-p \"foo\") (html-p \"bar\"))

The code is ported from html-lite.scm in the Gauche
distribution. Some things are missings but will be added asap.

I wrote this just for the fun of it and hope someone will find it
useful.")
