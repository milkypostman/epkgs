 :commentary "\
This spot of code makes M-x ffap look in some local directories for RFC
files before offering the ftp download in `ffap-rfc-path'.  It's good if
you keep copies of some RFCs locally, including perhaps from a packaged
distribution etc.

This feature has been merged into Emacs 23.  The code notices that and
does nothing there.  But there's no default value in
`ffap-rfc-directories' in emacs23, so if you were relying on
\"/usr/share/doc/RFC/links\" from the code here then add that back from
your .emacs etc.

If you keep local RFCs as compressed .gz etc you can enable jka-compr
with `(auto-compression-mode 1)' in the usual way to read them.  ffap
will fallback on the `ffap-rfc-path' download if there's a compressed
file but jka-compr is not enabled.

There's a lot of emacs RFC download/cache/search packages kicking around.
Several are listed at

ffap-rfc-directories.el is intentionally minimal, just saving you from
hitting ftp.rfc-editor.org every time.")
