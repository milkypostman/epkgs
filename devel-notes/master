Overview
========
This library provides an easy way of adding annotations
to source files and track them in an org file.


INSTALLING
==========
To install this library, save this file to a directory in your
`load-path' (you can view the current `load-path' using \"C-h v
load-path RET\" within Emacs), then add the following line to your
.emacs startup file:

   (require 'devel-notes)


USING
=====
To add an annotation to a source file run the command
`develnotes-add-annotation', this will let you choose the type and comment
for the annotation, and it will also be saved in `develnotes-file'.
In case there isn't such file you will be prompted the base directory
where to create it.

Note there are more `develnotes-add-TYPE' commands,
look at `develnotes-types-list' variable to find out existing options.

You can create the file `develnotes-file' manually running
`develnotes-create-file'.

To visit `develnotes-file' file in current window, run `develnotes-visit-file',
execute with a C-u to open in other window.


Customizing
===========
You can configure some variables to customize the package behaviour.

`develnotes-file': name of the `devel-notes' tracking file, default:
                   \"TODO.org\".
`develnotes-types-list': list of accepted types for entries, defaut:
                         (\"TODO\" \"FIXME\" \"BUG\" \"WARNING\" \"NOTE\" \"HACK\" \"XXX\").
`develnotes-timestamp-format': tTimestamp format, default \"%Y/%m/%d %H:%M\".
