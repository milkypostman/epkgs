 :commentary "\
This spot of code converts Perl single-quote '' strings to \"\", or back
again.  q{} and qq{} styles are supported, as are Locale::TextDomain
style __\"\" and N__\"\" translations.

Move point to the start of the target string and use `perl-quote-single'
to make it a single '', or `perl-quote-double' to make it a double.  The
suggested key bindings are C-c ' and C-c \" respectively, which
`perl-quote-keybindings' below can install.  See the docstrings for more.

Both commands use `forward-sexp' to find the end of string, so if you're
not in perl-mode or cperl-mode then the mode will have to understand perl
strings enough for `forward-sexp' to be right.  There's no real checking
of that, but for interactive use you can easily undo if it comes out
badly wrong.

Install

Put perl-quote.el in one of your `load-path' directories and in your
.emacs add

    (autoload 'perl-quote-keybindings \"perl-quote\")
    (add-hook 'perl-mode-hook  'perl-quote-keybindings)
    (add-hook 'cperl-mode-hook 'perl-quote-keybindings)

Or whichever perl-like modes you use, including maybe `pod-mode-hook' for
perl code samples in POD files.

There's autoload cookies for the functions and likely hook customize
options, if you know how to use `update-file-autoloads' and friends.")
