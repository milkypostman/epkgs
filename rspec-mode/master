Documentation:

This minor mode provides some enhancements to ruby-mode in
the contexts of RSpec specifications.  Namely, it provides the
following capabilities:

 * toggle back and forth between a spec and it's target (bound to
   `\\C-c ,t`)

 * verify the spec file associated with the current buffer (bound to `\\C-c ,v`)
 
 * verify the spec defined in the current buffer if it is a spec
   file (bound to `\\C-c ,v`)

 * verify the example defined at the point of the current buffer (bound to `\\C-c ,s`)

 * re-run the last verification process (bound to `\\C-c ,r`)

 * toggle the pendingness of the example at the point (bound to
   `\\C-c ,d`)

 * disable the example at the point by making it pending

 * reenable the disabled example at the point

 * run spec for entire project (bound to `\\C-c ,a`)

You can choose whether to run specs using 'rake spec' or the 'spec'
command. Use the customization interface (customize-group
rspec-mode) or override using (setq rspec-use-rake-flag TVAL).

Options will be loaded from spec.opts or .rspec if it exists, otherwise it
will fallback to defaults.

Dependencies
------------

This minor mode depends on `mode-compile`.  The expectations depend
`on el-expectataions.el`.  If `ansi-color` is available it will be
loaded so that rspec output is colorized properly.  If
`rspec-use-rvm` is set to true `rvm.el` is required.")
