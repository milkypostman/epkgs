 :commentary "\
This is a customisation of comint-mode (see comint.el)

Put this file into your load-path and the following into your ~/.emacs:
  (require 'inf-perl-mode)
  In windows expand-file-name is require because perl don't where is ~/psh.pl
  (setq perl-shell-program (expand-file-name \"~/psh.pl\"))
