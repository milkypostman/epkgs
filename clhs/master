 :commentary "\
Kent Pitman and the Harlequin Group (later Xanalys) have made the
text of the \"American National Standard for Information Technology --
Programming Language -- Common Lisp\", ANSI X3.226-1994 available on
the WWW, in the form of the Common Lisp HyperSpec.  This package
makes it convenient to peruse this documentation from within Emacs.

This is inspired by the Erik Naggum's version of 1997.")
