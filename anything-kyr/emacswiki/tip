Show context-aware commands by `anything'. It avoids forgetting
existence of appropriate commands. KYR is an abbreviation of \"Kuuki
wo YomeRu\", which means that person can read the atmosphere in
Japanese. Anything-kyr shows appropriate commands for the
situation.

Note that anything-kyr.el provides only the framework. See
anything-kyr-config.el for practical, polished, easy to use
configurations which can be used to assemble a custom personalized
configuration.
