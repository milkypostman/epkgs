I have always wanted 3 sorts of completion in Java:

1. complete a class name;  for when you're declaring variables

2. complete a method call; given text:
    someVar.meth

   - find the type of someVar
   - complete meth given the list of possible methods

3. complete package names in import statements

When I'm completing I'd like to see nice status about what has been completed.")
