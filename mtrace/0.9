This packages implements mtrace-mode, a minor mode that allows you
to get notified of changes occurring to hidden buffers.

It may for example be used to get notified when there is some
activity in an IRC channel buffer that is not currently displayed
in any window.

Another very useful feature is provided by the command
mtrace-pop-to-buffer, as it lets you switch directly to
those buffers where hidden activity occurred, even in your
absence.

mtrace-switch-to-buffer-other-window is analogous, but
selects the buffer in a different window.

New versions will be released in the following locations:
- http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?MtraceMode
- the gnu.emacs.sources newsgroup")
