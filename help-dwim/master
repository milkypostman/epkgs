 :commentary "\
I write a number of commands to search documents of symbols and
display them. It is hard to bind a common key for those command.
One command is need. So I write it to provide one command that
almost does everything.

Woman Note: The woman-topic-all-completions is create using
 woman-file-name which will prompt for the file name. So you
 may have to M-x woman before active woman.
