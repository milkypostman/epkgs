Just like display-time except that time, date, mail and appointment
notification are presented in the title-bar rather than the
mode-line.  This is useful if your mode-line gets a bit crowded.
Implemented by simply moving the string generated by `display-time'
from the model-line to the title-bar.

Installation:

Place this file somewhere in your load-path and

(require 'title-time)

somewhere in you .emacs file.  You may also want to set the
following variables

(setq display-time-day-and-date t)
(setq display-time-interval 30)
(setq display-time-24hr-format nil)
(setq display-time-string-forms
      (quote
       ((if (and (not display-time-format)
		 display-time-day-and-date)
	    (format-time-string \"%a %b %e   \" now) \"  \")
	(format-time-string
	 (or display-time-format
	     (if display-time-24hr-format \"%H:%M\" \"%-I:%M%p\")) now)
	\"    Load\" load \"    \" (if mail \" Mail\" \"\")))
      )")
