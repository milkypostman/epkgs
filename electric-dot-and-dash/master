This small hack makes it possible to enter left and right
parentheses by double tapping `.' or `-', respectively.  The keys
must be tapped in rapid succession, with a maximum delay taken from
the variable `electric-dot-and-dash-max-delay'.  When programming
Lisp, entering brackets is annoying since I have to use the
Shift-button and move my hand far up on the keyboard; I feel it
hampers the \"flow\" of typing.

On my Swedish keyboard, these keys are just above the space key,
slightly to the left.

The reason I wanted to try something like this was that it feels a
bit awkward having to press Shift+8 and Shift+9 to get at the
parentheses all the time when programming Lisp.

It would be interesting to hear of similar approaches.

I have only tried this for a few minutes and don't even know if I
like it (it might be totally useless), but I'll release it anyway
in case someone can find some use of it.

Enjoy!")
