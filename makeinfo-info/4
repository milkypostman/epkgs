 :commentary "\
This code extends `makeinfo-buffer' (C-c C-m C-b) in two ways,

    1. Display its result with `Info-mode', rather than a raw buffer.

    2. Follow a TeX-master variable for the top-level .texi of a
       multi-file document.

In Emacs 22 item 1 has been adopted, so just TeX-master is added there.
See the docstring of `makeinfo-info-makeinfo-buffer' below for details.

`makeinfo-region' (C-c C-m C-r) is unchanged, it still shows the raw
foo.info in fundamental mode.  This is probably good enough, since
usually only small sections of a document can be processed in isolation
anyway.")
