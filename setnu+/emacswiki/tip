Extensions to `setnu.el'.

 1. Enhances setnu mode so that it fits the frame to accomodate the
    line numbers.  This only occurs in one-window frames.

 2. Fixes setnu mode so that deletions of newlines are taken into
    account.  This code is based on `jde.el', by Paul Kinnucan
    <paulk@mathworks.com>, which, in turn, was apparently based on
    code by Jonathan Epstein <Jonathan_Epstein@nih.gov>.
    I'm not sure this fix is still needed.")
