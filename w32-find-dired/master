 :commentary "\
This is a light variant of `find-dired' for those who run Emacs on
w32.

Instead of using find, cmd.exe's `dir' command is used. The output
is then transformed to something dired can use, using
`insert-directory' from ls-lisp.el.

It does not support all things that `find-dired' can do, mostly
because the dir-command command used is not as powerful. It is also
\"hard coded\" into doing recursive directory listing.

Most of the code is ripped from find-dired.el
