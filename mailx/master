Its really annoying when subpar systems don't have GNUS
installed. I can't stand using another mail program because they
all seem to clobber my mailbox in some way. Then when I get home I
boot GNUS and have to undo all the frobs the mail program made and
get GNUS to sort out the mess. mailx is a quick hack to allow you
to read your mail without modifying your mailbox.

I use it when I'm at school and all I have is some crusty elm and
pine. Its quick, dirty, and...uhm...works.")
