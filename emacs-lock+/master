emacs-lock+ - extensions to standard library `emacs-lock.el'

 Features:

 - When locking any buffer, you are prompted for a little note that
   helps you to remember why you locked the buffer.
 
 - If any buffer prevents Emacs from exiting, pops up this buffer
   and displays your note if there is one.  Also displays the note
   if you try to kill any locked buffer (and, of course, prevents
   from killing)
 
 - Adds a mode-line indicator which displays a capital \"L\" for
   locked buffers (and a lowercase \"l\" for non-locked buffers, if
   this is enabled.  You can deactivate the indicator if you don't
   want it.)
   If you move the mouse over the indicator, the locking note
   is displayed, and (un-)locking can be done with the mouse.

 Installation: Put this file into a directory in your load-path and
 byte compile it.  Add

    (require 'emacs-lock+)

 to your Emacs init file (usually ~/.emacs).

 See (customize-group \"emacs-lock\") for options.
