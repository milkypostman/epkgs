This package provides a user-interface for hex viewing large file!!
Hexview mode can open a 5GB file within a second. If you often need
view large file for data debugging of probing, Hexview is for you!!
For viewing binary content, Hexview mode is much better than the
offical hexl-mode(using hexl program piping result in a lot memory
waste). The core part  of Hexview mode is just a simple builtin
function: `insert-file-contents-literally'. So Hexview doesn't need
large memory to view large file. Due to the limitation of emacs's
Integer representation , on 32-bit version, you can only view file
content up to index `268435455', but in 64-bit version `emacs' the
valid range of Integer is much larger. Practically, Hexview mode is
enough for 80% of you dailly usage. So enjoy.")
